American Banker reported that at least three large banks were planning to use the 5 percent payment option that the CFPB proposed in its 2015 framework to offer such customers small loans repayable in affordable installments at prices roughly six times lower than average payday loans, such as a $400, three-month loan for a $60 fee.6 Most Americans would like to see banks begin offering these loans.

Seventy percent of survey respondents said they would have a more favorable view of a bank if it offered a $400, three-month loan for a $60 fee (as some banks are planning to do).7 Banks report that they would need to use the 5 percent payment option in order to make these loans available.
